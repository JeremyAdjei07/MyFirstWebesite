<div class="AboutMe">    
    <p>Hi my name is Jeremy Adjei. I am a 16 year old Ghanian boy. I attend the school New Vision Charter High School for Advanced Math and Science 2. But as of right now I am currently attending the 2022 All Star Code Summer Intensive.

<div id="header2"><a name="ThingsILiketodo"><h1>Things I like to Do</h1></div></a>

<div class="Tiltd">
<p>In my freetime I like to do a lot of different things. For example I love playing video games. My top 5 video games are:</p>
</div>
<div id="list">
<ul>
    <li>GTA 5</li>
    <li>Rocket League</li>
    <li>Fifa </li>
    <li>2k</li>
    <li>Fortnite</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="Tiltd">
    <p>GTA is the BEST GAME. But in my free time I also like to play sports like basketball, football, and soccer. Especially basketball. But most of the time I would rather be talking on the phone with my friends or hanging out with my friends. I also like to code and watch anime. MY FAVORITE ANIME WILL FOREVER BE NARUTO.</p>
</div>

<div id="list">
    <ul>
        <li>NARUTO > MID PIECE</li>
    </ul>

<div id="header3">
    <a name="School"><h1>School</h1></a>
</div>

<div class="School">
<p>In the fall of 2022 I will officially start my senior year of high school. Even though there are multiple nerves that come with being a senior I am very excited because of the next step of going to college. I am not sure what I want to do when I grow up but I most definetly want it to be in the coding feild. The job that stands out the most right now is a Software Quality Assurance Analysts and Tester. Meaning I will most likely be a ccomputer science major. </p>
